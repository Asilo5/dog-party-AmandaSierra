# Dog Party

** Description

- Created two different css designs with one HTML.

- It is a page about dogs and their doggo language.

- Made both of them take the width of the whole page.

- Added Javascript so that whatever is written in the textbox can show on the word that was nested in the span.

- One can change the name, or name the dog.
